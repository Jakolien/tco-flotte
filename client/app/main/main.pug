        | Each year German corporations approve 800,000 new passenger cars to add to their fleets. Such stocks represent huge potential for electric mobility. Using electric vehicles in corporate vehicle fleets offers many advantages, even over private electric vehicle use. Firstly, in corporate fleets an electric vehicle&rsquo;s restricted driving range can be compensated by the ability to switch to conventional vehicles in the fleet when a longer range is needed. As well, electric vehicle charging stations can be more easily installed directly at the company to service several vehicles than at private homes for only a few vehicles. Through regular and organized vehicle use scheduling, the electrical and conventional vehicles can be easily shared between employees to improve cost-effectiveness.

        | But what are the total costs of an electric vehicle for commercial purposes compared to a diesel or gasoline vehicle? How may the total costs develop in the next years? What are the effects of different holding times and annual use levels? What is the effect on greenhouse gas emissions?
      p
        | These and other questions can be answered using the online TCO calculator developed by Oeko-Institut e.V. The calculator analyses the total costs for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in commercial applications. These costs include cost of vehicle acquisition and charging infrastructure for fuel and electric energy, vehicle maintenance, taxes, insurance, depreciation and the residual value of the vehicles.
