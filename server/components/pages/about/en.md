## Background

In Germany, 1.9 million passenger cars are registered each year by commercial owners. Out of these, approximately 800,000 cars are allotted to German corporate fleets – representing an enormous potential for electromobility. The use of electric vehicles in the fleet of a company has several advantages compared to private use. For example, the limited range has less impact when other pool vehicles are available. Also, it is easier to install and make full use of charging options on the company's premises. If the use of the vehicles is managed well, conflicts can be prevented and the economic efficiency of the vehicles can increase. 

## About the project

In the project “ePowered Fleets Hamburg”, approx. 500 electric vehicles have been integrated into corporate fleets in the Hamburg region. In this process, important insights are gained over a long period about the potential of electric vehicles in the context of fleet applications. The project is carried out in cooperation by the partners hySOLUTIONS, Alphabet Fuhrparkmanagemant and Öko-Institut. The project is funded by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety. 

The Öko-Institut evaluates the application of the vehicles scientifically. The use of the vehicles and potential usage barriers are analyzed as well as different procurement models. In addition, the economic efficiency is evaluated since it forms the basis for the potential of electric mobility in fleet applications. Finally, the possible contribution to the reduction of traffic-related greenhouse gas emissions is quantified. 

The latter aspects form the main focus of the advisory tool presented here. The online tool supports companies in the procurement of electric vehicles. Thus, it can contribute to the further market launch of electromobility in fleet applications. 

## About the tool

Which effects does the increased use of electric vehicles have on the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a commercial fleet? Which amount of greenhouse gas emissions is saved? 

How could a first step into electromobility look like? What could be the next steps for electrifying the fleet? Which routes can or must be replaced by alternative means of transportation? Are there kilometers that can be eliminated? How do the TCO and the climate footprint of the fleet change? 

What happens, if the model offering, the battery and vehicle costs, the energy prices etc. develop in a different way than currently expected? 

These and many other questions will be answered by the electromobility fleet calculator of the Öko-Institut. The user can use plausible default-settings for the leasing rate / acquisition price and residual value as well as the costs for charging infrastructure, fuels and electricity, workshop visits, taxes and insurances etc. On the other hand, you can modify the input parameters manually so that they suit your own requirements.
